<br>•	Example: If you want to use someone else's copyrighted music in a school project, we have to ask for permission or use music that is in the public domain                                                                                                        (Public domain: Works that are not protected by copyright and can be used by anyone)
<p>Copyright Infringement
<br>•	Definition: Copyright infringement occurs when someone uses, copies, distributes, or adapts a copyrighted work without permission. It is illegal and can result in legal penalties.
<p>Conclusion
<br>•	Copyright is essential for protecting the rights of creative individuals and encouraging the creation of new works.
<br>•	It allows creators to benefit from their creations while still promoting the sharing of knowledge and culture.
<br>•	Understanding copyright helps us respect the rights of creators and use their works responsibly and legally.
<br>•	The automatic copyright owner of a student's school essay or artwork is the student who created the work
