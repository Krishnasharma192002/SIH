           <h2>Understanding Patents in Intellectual Property Rights(IPR)</h2>
            <p>Patents: Protecting Inventions <br></p>
<br>What is a Patent? <br>
<br>•	Definition: A patent is a legal document granted by the government that gives inventors exclusive rights to their inventions for a certain period (usually 20 years). It's a reward for inventors in exchange for sharing their inventions with the public.
<br>•	In other words, a legal document that gives you the exclusive right to make, use, and sell an invention.
<br>•	Everything is not eligible for a patent such as fictional character in a novel.
 
<br>•	Example of patented invention is the light bulb (invented by Thomas Edison) <br>
<br>Types of Patents <br>

 
<br>1.	Utility Patents: <br>
<br>•	Definition: These protect new and useful inventions, like machines, processes, or chemical compositions.
<br>•	Example: A new type of bicycle with a unique gear system. <br>
<br>2.	Design Patents: <br>
<br>•	Definition: These protect the ornamental design or appearance of an object, not its function.
<br>•	Example: The distinctive shape of a Coca-Cola bottle. <br>
<br>3.	Plant Patents: <br>
<br>•	Definition: These protect new varieties of plants that are asexually reproduced.
<br>•	Example: A unique type of rose created through grafting. <br>
<br>What Patents Protect <br>
<br>•	Exclusive Rights: Patents give inventors the exclusive right to make, use, and sell their invention for the duration of the patent.
<br>•	Prevents Copying: It prevents others from making, selling, or using the same invention without permission. <br>
<br>How to Get a Patent <br>
<br>•	Application: Inventors must apply for a patent with their country's patent office. They must describe the invention in detail.
<br>•	Review Process: The patent office reviews the application to ensure the invention is new, useful, and non-obvious.
<br>•	Granting: If approved, the patent is granted, and the inventor gains exclusive rights, such as The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) grants patents in the U.S. <br>

<br>Why Patents are Important <br>
<br>•	Encourage Innovation: Patents reward inventors for their hard work and innovation, which encourages them to create new and better products.
<br>•	Share Knowledge: Patents require inventors to share their ideas and discoveries with the public, advancing technology and knowledge.
<br>•	Purpose: To give the inventor exclusive rights to their invention for a limited time.
<br>•	Licensing: A patent holder allows other to use their invention for a free by having it. <br>


 

<br>Patent Infringement <br>
<br>•	Definition: If someone uses, makes, or sells an invention covered by someone else's patent without permission, it's called patent infringement.
<br>•	Penalties: Infringement can lead to legal action, fines, and even the loss of the right to use the patent. <br>
<br>Duration of Patents <br>
<br>•	Utility patents: Last for 20 years from the date of filing.
<br>•	Design patents: Last for 15 years from the date of grant. <br>
<br>Conclusion <br>
<br>•	Patents are essential for protecting inventions and encouraging innovation.
<br>•	They grant inventors exclusive rights for a certain period in exchange for sharing their ideas with the public.
<br>•	Understanding patents helps us respect inventors' rights and appreciate their contributions to technology and society. <br>
